# Conversations Directory

This is the root folder for all conversations related to the AWS framework codebase development and maintenance.

## Structure

The conversation structure mirrors the file and folder structure of the main codebase. This parallel organization allows for easy navigation and context understanding when reviewing conversations about specific parts of the codebase.

### Organization Pattern

For any file or folder in the main codebase located at:
```
src/{folder_name}/{file_name}
```

The corresponding conversations are stored at:
```
conversations/{folder_name}/sessions/{timestamp_file_name}
```

### Example Structure

If the main codebase has:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── login.js
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── metrics.js
├── services/
│   └── api/
│       └── client.js
└── utils/
    └── helpers.js
```

Then the conversations directory would contain:
```
conversations/
├── components/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── sessions/
│   │       ├── 2024-07-01_14-30-15_login-discussion.md
│   │       ├── 2024-07-02_09-15-42_auth-refactor.md
│   │       └── 2024-07-03_16-22-08_security-review.md
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── sessions/
│           ├── 2024-07-01_11-45-30_metrics-implementation.md
│           └── 2024-07-02_13-20-15_performance-optimization.md
├── services/
│   └── api/
│       └── sessions/
│           ├── 2024-06-30_10-15-22_client-setup.md
│           └── 2024-07-01_15-30-45_error-handling.md
└── utils/
    └── sessions/
        └── 2024-07-01_12-00-30_helper-functions.md
```

## Purpose

This organization system enables:

- **Context Preservation**: Conversations about specific files are stored alongside their logical location
- **Easy Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant discussions about any part of the codebase
- **Historical Tracking**: All conversations related to a specific component are grouped together
- **Parallel Development**: The conversation structure evolves with the codebase structure

## Usage

When working on any part of the codebase, refer to the corresponding conversation folder to understand:
- Previous design decisions
- Implementation discussions
- Bug fixes and troubleshooting
- Feature development conversations
- Code review discussions

This README serves as a reference for understanding how conversations are organized and stored within this AWS framework project.
