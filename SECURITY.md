# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This framework implements security best practices for AWS serverless applications. However, additional security measures should be implemented based on your specific use case.

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation using AWS Cognito
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API Gateway integration with Cognito User Pools
- Private file access controls

### Data Protection
- S3 server-side encryption (AES-256)
- VPC isolation for private resources
- Presigned URLs with short expiration times
- Input validation and sanitization

### Network Security
- VPC with private subnets for Lambda functions
- Security groups with least privilege access
- CloudFront for DDoS protection
- Private API endpoints for internal communication

## Security Considerations

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for sensitive data
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **IAM Permissions**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Review and audit IAM policies regularly
   - Use resource-specific permissions where possible

3. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request size limits
   - Enable AWS WAF for additional protection
   - Use API keys for additional access control

4. **File Upload Security**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan uploaded files for malware
   - Implement content-based validation
   - Use separate domains for user-generated content

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Enable CloudTrail for API logging
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activity
   - Implement structured logging in Lambda functions
   - Monitor failed authentication attempts

### Recommended Additional Security Measures

1. **Enable AWS Config** for compliance monitoring
2. **Implement AWS GuardDuty** for threat detection
3. **Use AWS Security Hub** for centralized security findings
4. **Enable VPC Flow Logs** for network monitoring
5. **Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures**

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:
1. Do not create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to [your-security-email]
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue

## Security Updates

This framework will be updated regularly to address security vulnerabilities. Always use the latest version in production environments.

## Compliance

This framework provides building blocks for compliance with:
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR (with additional data handling procedures)
- HIPAA (with additional BAA and encryption requirements)
- PCI DSS (with additional security controls)

Note: Compliance certification requires additional implementation beyond this framework.
